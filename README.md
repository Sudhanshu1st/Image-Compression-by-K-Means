# Image-Compression-by-K-Means

In this project I have picked up a simple png image and compressed it using K-means. 
This project was a part of my Unsupervised Machine Learning Course by Andrew NG. 

### The K-means algorithm is a method to automatically cluster similar data points together.

- Concretely, you are given a training set {x(1), x(2)..... x(m)} and you want
to group the data into a few cohesive “clusters”.

K-means is an iterative procedure that
- Starts by guessing the initial centroids, and then
- Refines this guess by
  - Repeatedly assigning examples to their closest centroids, and then
  - Recomputing the centroids based on the assignments.
